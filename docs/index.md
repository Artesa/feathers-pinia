actionLink: /guide/
features:
  - title: 🍍 Powered by Pinia
    details: Pinia is Vuex 5. It's a joy to use with a clean API and memorable syntax.

  - title: 🧁 Best Practices Baked In
    details: Vue 3 + Composition API 😎 Common Redux patterns included. SWR Fall-through cache by default. Query the store like a local database.

  - title: ⚡️ Realtime by Default
    details: Realtime isn't an afterthought or add-on. With Live Queries, watch your data update as new data arrives from the Feathers server.

  - title: ➳ Feathers-Vuex Friendly
    details: Works in existing Feathers-Vuex apps with a similar API. Prepare for Vuex 5 by migrating individual services over time.

  - title: 🥷 Powerful Data Modeling
    details: Define data structures. Write cleaner code with model-level computed properties.

  - title: SWR with more Cow Bell 🐮
    details: A step up from SWR, Feathers-Pinia can intelligently re-use data across different queries, making apps feel faster. Or go realtime and make SWR obsolete.
